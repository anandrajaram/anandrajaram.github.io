        <p class="post-summary"><p><a href="http://productcampboston.org/">ProductCamp Boston</a>, the awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> on Product Management, returns on Saturday, April 2, 2011 at the Microsoft New England Research and Development Center in Cambridge. I have been to prior year’s ProductCamps and they rock!  (I am pretty bummed that I can’t make it this year, because I will be out of the country at that time.)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/ProductCampBoston.png" alt="ProductCampBoston" /></p>

<p>If you are not familiar with UnConferences, you should definitely go to this one. There are no “attendees,” since everyone participates in some manner.  At ProductCamp, you’ll get to present, lead a roundtable discussion, share your experiences, and/or volunteer. Every single unconference that I have gone to (such as the MassTLC unconference, ProductCamp and BarCamp), has been memorable and insightful. They are a great way to meet fellow Product Managers and share ideas and exchange notes on common challenges, industry trends and network!</p>

<p>This year’s theme is “Innovation” – and it’s all about product, process and personal innovation to help you and your company win. You get to propose topics, deliver talks, attend sessions all around that theme. So what are you waiting for?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://productcampboston.org/register/">Register Now</a> and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://productcampboston.org/2011/03/17/how-to-propose-a-session-in-7-steps/">Propose a Session</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, tell me all about it, since I cant be there. Oh! and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pcampboston">you should also follow ProductCamp on twitter</a></p>

I dont care <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/07/sxsgah/">what the naysayers say</a>, I am determined to have a fun time, especially while meeting our customers as part of <a href="http://thesmallbusinessweb.com">the Small business web</a> Party!

<p>In addition to the Lean Startup tracks, I am also looking forward to the tracks on User Interface Design (iPad Design, Metrics Driven Design to name a few). It should be fun to bump into some familiar <a href="http://bostinnovation.com/2011/03/07/boston-all-up-in-sxswi-preview-sxswbos/?ref=act&amp;buid=0">Boston area peeps</a> in <a href="http://bostoninaustinsxsw.eventbrite.com/#m_1_200">Boston In Austin happy hour</a>. I booked an apartment through <a href="http://airbnb.com">AirBnB</a> (my first time, so lets hope this works out!) and I have also armed myself with the latest versions of Foursquare, Groupme, Beluga and Plancast. Austin, here I come!!!</p>

<p>Are you going to South-by? Here is a quick embed from my Plancast feed.</p>

<p>And, here are some tips on how to be South by South Best!</p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>By now, <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=gmail">Everything that needs to be said </a>about the Gmail outage has been said. Maybe not, until I have added my 2 cents. Haha.  I was curious <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/gmail-back-soon-for-everyone.html">what Google would say in this matter</a> and how they would react. Similar to my earlier post on the<a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2011/01/anatomy-of-an-apple-email/"> Anatomy of a customer service email</a>, here are my thoughts on Google’s well written blog post:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/Official-Gmail-Blog.png" alt="Gmail Outage Blog Post" />]</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Say, sorry, straight up. Not wishy washy, not the “We apologize for any inconvenienced this may have sort of caused” kind, but a straight up one human to another kind. Sorry!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now give them the good news on how you have rectified the issue. Provide details on how many were impacted, what the impact was and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, provide an explanation. Many people may just care about the first two items (the fact that they are apologizing and why it is ok now). If you do need an explanation, provide a meaningful one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a concrete timeline on when the issue will be resolved. This is one missing component from this post.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talk about why this won’t happen again. The post only alludes to it, it could have done a better job on this front.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apologize again and end on an empathetic / positive forward looking comment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How have you communicated bad news to your customers? Do you think Google’s response is adequate? Does it convince you?</p>

          <h3 class="h2 post-title">The many quirks of Email Marketing</h3>
        
        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>If you have tried to send a decent looking HTML email as part of your <a href="http://blog.bronto.com/2009/04/16/lifecycle-marketing-whats-love-got-to-do-with-it/">lifecycle marketing</a>, you are probably aware of the painful details that you to worry about. The whole point of Lifecycle marketing is to get your message hyper-personalized and relevant to your customer, based on which stage of the funnel they are in. In addition to figuring out the different types of customers, which stage they are at and what to message to them at that stage, you have also probably figured out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">what SPF means</a> ( no, not the kind you put on at the beach) and can likely teach a Microsoft engineer about how Microsoft<a href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2007/01/10/microsoft-breaks-html-email-rendering-in-outlook/"> Outlook renders emails vastly differently between 2003 and 2007</a>. Ditto about how the same email shows up differently between Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail. ESPs such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1018078/testing-html-email-rendering">Campaign Monitor and MailChimp provide tools</a> that you can use to verify how your email will show up in a variety of different mail clients.</p>

<p>But I just realized the other day (not surprising on hindsight) that there is another variable in this equation. <strong>Your browser</strong>. Here is the email that I was designing (with the images turned on).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/email-with-images.png" alt="Email with images" /></p>

<p>Like any good marketer, I setup alt-text in my email so that users see meaningful content when images are disabled (and every client except Apple Mail disables it by default). Heck, I even phrased it such that I nudged the user to enable images. But for some mysterious reason, the alt text didn’t show up in Gmail.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/gmail-chrome-no-alt-text.png" alt="Gmail chrome no alt text" /></p>

<p>After some investigation (and thanks to some useful pointers from MailChimp), it turned out that the issue does not have to do with Gmail but with Chrome. The same email (received in Gmail), displays Alt-Text perfectly fine in FireFox. Here is the same email in Firefox, with all the ALT-Text goodness.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/gmail-firefox.png" alt="Gmail firefox" /></p>

<p>Ah, well, if I had a dime for every HTML email quirk, I’d probably be Bill Gates (Whoa, is that how he became the richest man, haha)? But Wait, there is more.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome for Gmail Does show Alt-Text in Gmail, Sort of, sometimes</strong></p>

<p>It is not as if Chrome doesn’t always show the Alt-text when rendering images at Gmail. It actually does show it, in some of the cases. You can tweak your alt+text length and figure this out by trial and error. This is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=51533">documented bug for Chrome</a> . From a Google Search, it looks like I am coming a bit late to this party, and the issues has been known for a few years now. I am still so aghast, I had to write about this.</p>

<p>Good luck getting those emails nice, pretty and accessible. May the force be with you.</p>
