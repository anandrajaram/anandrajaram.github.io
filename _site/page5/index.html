  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="description">
    <p>If you have tried to send a decent looking HTML email as part of your <a href="http://blog.bronto.com/2009/04/16/lifecycle-marketing-whats-love-got-to-do-with-it/">lifecycle marketing</a>, you are probably aware of the painful details that you to worry about. The whole point of Lifecycle marketing is to get your message hyper-personalized and relevant to your customer, based on which stage of the funnel they are in. In addition to figuring out the different types of customers, which stage they are at and what to message to them at that stage, you have also probably figured out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">what SPF means</a> ( no, not the kind you put on at the beach) and can likely teach a Microsoft engineer about how Microsoft<a href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2007/01/10/microsoft-breaks-html-email-rendering-in-outlook/"> Outlook renders emails vastly differently between 2003 and 2007</a>. Ditto about how the same email shows up differently between Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail. ESPs such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1018078/testing-html-email-rendering">Campaign Monitor and MailChimp provide tools</a> that you can use to verify how your email will show up in a variety of different mail clients.</p>

<p>But I just realized the other day (not surprising on hindsight) that there is another variable in this equation. <strong>Your browser</strong>. Here is the email that I was designing (with the images turned on).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/email-with-images.png" alt="Email with images"></p>

<p>Like any good marketer, I setup alt-text in my email so that users see meaningful content when images are disabled (and every client except Apple Mail disables it by default). Heck, I even phrased it such that I nudged the user to enable images. But for some mysterious reason, the alt text didn&#39;t show up in Gmail.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/gmail-chrome-no-alt-text.png" alt="Gmail chrome no alt text"></p>

<p>After some investigation (and thanks to some useful pointers from MailChimp), it turned out that the issue does not have to do with Gmail but with Chrome. The same email (received in Gmail), displays Alt-Text perfectly fine in FireFox. Here is the same email in Firefox, with all the ALT-Text goodness.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/gmail-firefox.png" alt="Gmail firefox"></p>

<p>Ah, well, if I had a dime for every HTML email quirk, I&#39;d probably be Bill Gates (Whoa, is that how he became the richest man, haha)? But Wait, there is more.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome for Gmail Does show Alt-Text in Gmail, Sort of, sometimes</strong></p>

<p>It is not as if Chrome doesn&#39;t always show the Alt-text when rendering images at Gmail. It actually does show it, in some of the cases. You can tweak your alt+text length and figure this out by trial and error. This is a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=51533">documented bug for Chrome</a> . From a Google Search, it looks like I am coming a bit late to this party, and the issues has been known for a few years now. I am still so aghast, I had to write about this.</p>

<p>Good luck getting those emails nice, pretty and accessible. May the force be with you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="description">
    <p>This is Part 2 of my notes from the Boston Lean Startup Circle January meetup. You may also want to check out <a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2011/01/notes-from-lean-startup-circle-boston-jan-2011-meetup-part-1/">Part 1 of the notes</a>. Part 2 focuses on the key questions that Lean Startups face. What are the some of the key questions that every startup faces, and what are the some of the ways in which Lean Startups can find answers to those questions?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>How do we know when to pivot?</strong>
Lean Startup know to pivot when the product decisions and experiments are not &quot;moving the needle&quot;. The worst scenario that a startup can be is the so-called &quot;Land of the Living Dead&quot;, where there is some growth but not enough growth to have meaningful traction. And it is important that the &quot;needle&quot; is not something defined using vanity metrics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do Vision, Strategy and  Product relate to each other?</strong>
Vision is all about the big picture. It is about changing the world.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/vision-strategy-product.jpg" alt="">  And you dont really iterate on the Vision. Strategy is about how you build a business to achieve that vision. And a Product is nothing but one instantiation of the strategy. When you pivot, what you do is to change strategy. You change who you sell to, how you sell or even what you sell.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>*<em>What should we measure?
*</em>Be sure not to track growth or traction using <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/02/entrepreneurs_beware_of_vanity_metrics.html">Vanity metrics</a>. You might have gotten good PR and a lot of pageviews / uniques, but what is important is if those resulted in real conversions, and more importantly if those newly acquired users are engaged with the product. You need to take into account that Metrics are people too and define a set of &quot;per customer metrics&quot; that tracks user level engagement, retention and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do Products grow?</strong>
At a fundamental level, how do you know if your product is growing?</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply the Value Test: Ask yourself, does my product create value?</li>
<li>If so, Do you have an engine of growth : All successful businesses need a viable engine of growth. There are three typical engines of growth.
a.) <strong>The Paid Engine of Growth</strong>: It is pretty simple, you just charge for your product
b.) <strong>Viral Growth</strong>: Your product gets used more because of Virality, and your users have an incentive to spread the word about your product (Facebook is  the obvious example).
c.) <strong>Sticky / Compounding Growth</strong> : This is when your users show unusually high engagement over long periods of time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>What is in the MVP? And How do I use Landing Page Testing when there is not enough traffic?</strong>
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the least amount of work needed to learn the most amount in whichever part of the business has the</p></li>
</ol>

<p>[<img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/sapling-150x150.jpg" alt="MVP - Photo courtesy of Scragz @ Flickr">]</p>

<p>maximum uncertainty. If you are not quite sure if something should be in the MVP or not, then &quot;NO&quot; is a good answer. It is always possible to test demand using smoke tests and fake landing pages, even when there is not adequate Search traffic or if people are not searching for what you are building. Outside the<a href="http://www.justin.tv/startuplessonslearned/b/262672510"> now familiar example of DropBox</a>, Eric also highlighted an interesting newer perspective on how they used Landing Page testing in IMVU.  At the time, IMVU was testing channels where IM/Chat would have demand. So they took a wide range of keywords with good traffic (Such as World of Warcraft, Starbucks etc,.), bid on these keywords and added the word &quot;Chat&quot; as part of the ad. While the absolute conversion rates (say 1.5 % for World of Warcraft and 0.2% for Starbucks didn&#39;t mean anything), the fact that World of Warcraft Chat converted much higher _Relative to _Starbucks Chat is a strong signal on which would be a more effective channel.</p>

<ol>
<li>*<em>How do I help my organization Adopt Lean Methodologies?
*</em>The best way to show results / proof is to find one area where the current setup hurts the most and apply lean principles there. Be sure to try it where you have the authority. And if you are a founder, it is very important to know that you cannot delegate Customer Development to the &quot;Sales Department&quot;. Good Sales People don&#39;t take no for an answer and Customer Development is all about listening to the NO that your prospective users says, factoring it into the product and pivoting. Bring on Paid Sales people when you have found a repeatable way to sell your product.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have already been using some of these questions as a valuable way to power my &quot;Validated Learning&quot; . I am hoping to blog more about our pivots and metrics in the future. What is on your mind? What questions do you have as you apply Lean Startup principles to your idea? Let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="description">
    <p>Lean Startup Jan Meetup was exciting, thanks to a presentation by Eric Ries. Thanks to HBS and their course on Entrepreneurial Management, I am hoping Eric will be around town more often, and we get to pick his brains on all kinds of interesting things on Lean Startups. The original announcement promised to go <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Lean-Startup-Circle-Boston/events/15929961/">&quot;Beyond methodology&quot;</a>. I felt like Eric couldn&#39;t get to a lot of the  &quot;new material&quot; until the end, which was a bummer, but the Q &amp; A session made up for that in some ways.</p>

<p>This is Part 1 of my notes from the session (some of them are recaps, <a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2010/04/drinking-from-the-fire-hose-lessons-i-learned-from-the-startup-lessons-learned-conference-part-1/">all the way back to #sllconf last year</a>). Stay tuned for Part 2 over the weekend.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The  Unit of progress in a startup cannot be that of  &quot;advancing to the next stage&quot;.  That way of looking at things, is mostly based on three &quot;Shadow Beliefs&quot; :</p>

<ul>
<li>We know what customers want</li>
<li>We can actually predict the future</li>
<li>Advancing the plan is &quot;progress&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, the more appropriate unit of progress in a Startup is &quot;Validated Learning&quot;. In effect, your startup&#39;s success depends on how many times you can go through the &quot;Build -&gt; Measure -&gt; Learn&quot; loop, and you maximize the number of times through the loop, by optimizing through the ENTIRE LOOP and not just a specific part of it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you are in a startup, you no longer have a functional discipline. You are not a programmer, not a marketer, you should do whatever is needed at that moment. Personally, I am a big believer in this idea, and this is one big part of what motivates me to start / work for a startup. I have had intense discussions on term sheets, design and send email marketing, hack a script to do cohort analysis, figure out a weird issue with &quot;phrase search&quot; in our search engine and be on phone-support and live-chat support, all in the same week.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert Customary slide about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03/ok-pivot-is-officially-over-used/">pivot being the &quot;P-word&quot; </a> and funny <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/images/2010/04/26/cartoons/100426_cartoon_1_a14895_p465.gif">NewYorker cartoon</a> :</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/newyorker-pivot.gif" alt="newyorker-pivot.gif"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Now it gets interesting. Eric crystallized Lean startups into 5 important principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lean.st/principles/entrepreneurs-are-everywhere"><strong>Entrepreneurs are everywhere</strong></a> : In effect, wherever there is uncertainty, there is entrepreneurship. This is a bit of a blue-sky, mom-and-apple-pie notion, but I&#39;ll play along. Every earth shattering idea is something simple at its core and this could be one such core of Lean Startups. The larger point is that Lean Principles need not be applicable only to startups, they can as well be applied to other contexts.</li>
<li><a href="http://lean.st/principles/entrepreneurship-is-management"><strong>Entrepreneurship IS management</strong></a> : Entrepreneurial management is a peer-level to the more traditional MBA-like General Management. One is not better than the other, they are just different. General Management focuses on processes, efficiencies, scale while Entrepreneurial Management focuses on trying to find a sustainable business model.</li>
<li><a href="http://lean.st/principles/validated-learning"><strong>Validated Learning</strong></a>: See notes above</li>
<li><a href="http://lean.st/principles/build-measure-learn"><strong>Build - Measure - Learn</strong></a>: Refer to the Kent Beck session notes <a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2010/04/drinking-from-the-fire-hose-lessons-i-learned-from-the-startup-lessons-learned-conference-part-1/">from my earlier blog post from #sllconf 2010</a></li>
<li><strong>Innovation Accounting</strong>: It is essential for a startup to focus on actionable data, and not on vanity metrics. Metrics that always go up and to the right (such as Cumulative total accounts) don&#39;t matter. Metrics that reflect random environmental events, press releases (such as Pageviews) don&#39;t matter. Metrics that focus on Per customer engagement are very important. How many times have users logged in? How many people have they referred? (#aarrr). Eric&#39;s point was that we need an accounting paradigm that lets entrepreneurs communicate quantitatively what they have done by way of validated learning. This kind of a paradigm will be helpful when raising money. (I really like this term, and I hope it doesn&#39;t get abused and overused like Pivot was)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>And here are the soundbites from my twitter stream during the event :</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/twitter-search-leanstartup.png" alt="twitter-search-leanstartup.png"></p>

<p>Did you attend the event? What did you get out of it? Stay tuned for Part 2, for some of the questions that every lean startup faces and how to head in the right direction when faced with those questions.</p>

    <p>Microsoft launched a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5737162/microsoft-onenote-comes-to-the-iphone">iOS version of the popular OneNote software</a>. Back when I was using Windows, I remember feeling pretty impressed by its functionality and ease of use
<img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/confused_funnel.jpg" alt="Confused Funnel">.</p>

<p>I was curious to see if Microsoft had pushed any envelope / come up with something cool in terms of user-interface (The Ribbon interface, anyone?), so like any good kid, I installed the app from the app store. I still haven&#39;t gotten to use it and the sign up process turned out to have as many roadblocks as you can possibly imagine. In effect, it seems that the signup was a hurried afterthought, not at all designed for the mobile platform. There is no clear and frictionless path to signup, no sense of instant gratification for the user.</p>

<p>Let me explain further:</p>

<p>When you try to sign up, it seems to display a web-page based form, as opposed to a native form. There is nothing wrong with this, especially, if it gets you to market quickly. But wait, the form is not designed for a mobile app. It has a captcha! Lets just make people type more in their virtual or tiny keyboards.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/captcha-fail.png" alt="captcha fail"></p>

<p>Being the relentless guy that I am, I went through with it, and signed up. But wait, I first am going to have to confirm my registration using a link that was sent to the email address I provided. I need to switch apps, and unless I am really motivated, I probably wont come back to it. But I was. So I switch to my Mail Client, opened the email, and clicked the confirmation link only to find out that the link cannot be activated on a mobile platform.</p>

<p>Fail, Fail, and Fail. Next.</p>
