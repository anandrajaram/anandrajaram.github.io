        <p class="post-summary"><p>A couple of weeks back my trusted (rusted?) 3 year old MacBook pro wouldn’t boot. By the sounds of it, it was pretty obvious that it wasn’t something I could fix / hack, so I took it to the local Apple store. I had put on my “I am a Mac” T-shirt hoping to score some brownie points at the genius bar.</p>

<p>A quick diagnosis at the genius bar showed that the motherboard had likely conked. So it had to shipped to their depot to have it replaced. The extended apple care warranty had just expired, but the “genius” at the genius bar was gracious enough to “let it slide” and told me he would take care of it without charging anything. Wow!! That’s probably a good $300 worth of repairs.</p>

<p>I was supposed to have received my machine back in 5 to 7 business days, but lo and behold, I got a call in just 2 days saying my machine was ready. Woot. Awesome Apple. But wait, there is more. Not only was the logic board replaced, Apple had also replaced the optical drive and two fans, since they were not in “good condition”. What a nice gesture. But wait, there is even more!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/20110508-104430.jpg" alt="mahatma-Gandhi-customer" /></p>

<p>One of the rubber pads at the bottom of the MacBook had fallen off. I was curious what they had done about it and sure enough all four of them were replaced. I mean, who cares about the rubber pads at the bottom, except of course the user. You don’t even have to be a fanboy like me, to be impressed by such attention to detail.</p>

<p>I was happy enough when Apple fixed my machine for free, even though it was out of warranty. But such attention to detail truly delights your customers. It demonstrates empathy, and it shows your customer that you care about them.</p>

<p>Fixing something with a bunch of goodies makes your customers happy. Going above and beyond what is needed and paying attention to detail delights them enough to write a blog post about it and tell the story to everyone in their inner circle of friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>Are you delighting your customers?</p>

        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p><a href="http://productcampboston.org/">ProductCamp Boston</a>, the awesome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> on Product Management, returns on Saturday, April 2, 2011 at the Microsoft New England Research and Development Center in Cambridge. I have been to prior year’s ProductCamps and they rock!  (I am pretty bummed that I can’t make it this year, because I will be out of the country at that time.)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/ProductCampBoston.png" alt="ProductCampBoston" /></p>

<p>If you are not familiar with UnConferences, you should definitely go to this one. There are no “attendees,” since everyone participates in some manner.  At ProductCamp, you’ll get to present, lead a roundtable discussion, share your experiences, and/or volunteer. Every single unconference that I have gone to (such as the MassTLC unconference, ProductCamp and BarCamp), has been memorable and insightful. They are a great way to meet fellow Product Managers and share ideas and exchange notes on common challenges, industry trends and network!</p>

<p>This year’s theme is “Innovation” – and it’s all about product, process and personal innovation to help you and your company win. You get to propose topics, deliver talks, attend sessions all around that theme. So what are you waiting for?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://productcampboston.org/register/">Register Now</a> and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://productcampboston.org/2011/03/17/how-to-propose-a-session-in-7-steps/">Propose a Session</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, tell me all about it, since I cant be there. Oh! and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pcampboston">you should also follow ProductCamp on twitter</a></p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>This is my first <a href="http://sxsw.com">SXSW</a> and I am excited. I dont care <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/07/sxsgah/">what the naysayers say</a>, I am determined to have a fun time, especially while meeting our customers as part of <a href="http://thesmallbusinessweb.com">the Small business web</a> Party! (and <a href="http://startable.com">Healy Jones</a> will be joining me too!)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/sxsw.jpeg" alt="Sxsw" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>In addition to the Lean Startup tracks, I am also looking forward to the tracks on User Interface Design (iPad Design, Metrics Driven Design to name a few). It should be fun to bump into some familiar <a href="http://bostinnovation.com/2011/03/07/boston-all-up-in-sxswi-preview-sxswbos/?ref=act&amp;buid=0">Boston area peeps</a> in <a href="http://bostoninaustinsxsw.eventbrite.com/#m_1_200">Boston In Austin happy hour</a>. I booked an apartment through <a href="http://airbnb.com">AirBnB</a> (my first time, so lets hope this works out!) and I have also armed myself with the latest versions of Foursquare, Groupme, Beluga and Plancast. Austin, here I come!!!</p>

<p>Are you going to South-by? Here is a quick embed from my Plancast feed.</p>

<p>And, here are some tips on how to be South by South Best!</p>

        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>By now, <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=gmail">Everything that needs to be said </a>about the Gmail outage has been said. Maybe not, until I have added my 2 cents. Haha.  I was curious <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/gmail-back-soon-for-everyone.html">what Google would say in this matter</a> and how they would react. Similar to my earlier post on the<a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2011/01/anatomy-of-an-apple-email/"> Anatomy of a customer service email</a>, here are my thoughts on Google’s well written blog post:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/Official-Gmail-Blog.png" alt="Gmail Outage Blog Post" />]</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Say, sorry, straight up. Not wishy washy, not the “We apologize for any inconvenienced this may have sort of caused” kind, but a straight up one human to another kind. Sorry!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now give them the good news on how you have rectified the issue. Provide details on how many were impacted, what the impact was and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, provide an explanation. Many people may just care about the first two items (the fact that they are apologizing and why it is ok now). If you do need an explanation, provide a meaningful one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a concrete timeline on when the issue will be resolved. This is one missing component from this post.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talk about why this won’t happen again. The post only alludes to it, it could have done a better job on this front.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apologize again and end on an empathetic / positive forward looking comment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How have you communicated bad news to your customers? Do you think Google’s response is adequate? Does it convince you?</p>
