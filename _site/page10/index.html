        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>I am excited to announce that my company has changed its name to <a href="http://www.officedrop.com">OfficeDrop</a> . There were several key lessons that I learnt during the planning and implementation of the re-branding effort (which is still in progress). We engaged our current and future customers in the name-selection process and thus far the response to the new name has been quite positive.</p>

<p>Our friendly customer service (which I am very proud of), simple user interface and world-class operations are all the same. We will continue to be a very easy to use <a href="http://www.officedrop.com">document management and document scanning service for small businesses</a>. Now our name reflects that better.</p>

<p>I also got to edit the video where Prasad (my partner in crime and CEO of OfficeDrop) talks about the name-change, (inspired by my recent purchase of a brand spanking new Canon camcorder). Here it is, in all its HD glory, to know more about why we changed our name. </p>

<p>Exciting times, and hopefully I will get the time to blog about all those lessons learnt.</p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>I mentioned in <a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2009/12/the-cloud-got-a-bit-more-elastic-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/">my earlier post</a> that it would be interesting to compare prices between spot prices and traditional instance prices. The data is already available at http://cloudexchange.org/charts/us-east-1.linux.m1.small.html and it looks like spot prices are waaayy lower than traditional prices.</p>

<p>Stay tuned and it is going to be interesting how this pans out.</p>

          <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Cloud got a bit more elastic - Amazon EC2 Spot instances</h3>
        
        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>At the <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/12/11/thank-you-to-our-cloud3-speakers-seeders-sponsors-and-underwriters-and-an-update-on-speaker-slides/">Xconomy Cloud^3 conference and unpanel</a> last week, there was a lot of great discussion around the Cloud’s cost economics and at what point the Cloud becomes more expensive than a in-house data center. As part of the unpanel discussion, I had mentioned that cost models will continue to evolve in the cloud and that we are in the very early stages.</p>

<p>And here it is, the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2009/12/ec2-spot-instances-and-now-how-much-would-you-pay.html">Amazon Ec2 Spot pricing</a>. The concept is seemingly straightforward (with a somewhat unexpected twist). You can bid for “Spot Instances” where you specify the price you are willing to pay for an EC2 instance. To quote the AWS blog “As requests come in and unused capacity becomes available, we’ll evaluate the open bids for each Region and compute a new Spot Price for each instance type”. And here is the twist. After that <strong>we’ll terminate any Spot Instances with bids below the Spot Price</strong>, and launch instances for requests with bids higher than or at the new Spot Price. The instances will be billed at the then-current Spot Price regardless of the actual bid. I don’t know why the instances would have to be terminated, rather than a simple re-calculation of the price of running the instance, but this seems like a fun experiment.</p>

<p>To be able to fully take advantage of this kind of flexibility being offered, your application (actually I should background jobs) would have to be totally stateless and be able to resume from any where in a workflow. Queuing mechanisms such as SQS come in handy. Like I mentioned in my talk, it is probably good design anyway to be stateless. And of course, please don’t run your web server or user-facing applications in a Spot instance. That is a guaranteed way to get fired.</p>

<p>All in all, I think this is more of a pricing experiment from Amazon’s perspective, more than anything else. Getting every additional dollar out of your excess capacity is a centuries old problem (think free business cards from VistaPrint), and I’d be interested in knowing how this pans out for Amazon and how Spot prices compare to traditional prices.</p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>I found this fascinating quote today:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>I believe that in startups, like venture investing, the cost of making a bad decision is not nearly as great as the benefit of making a good one. So I like action oriented leaders.avc.com, <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/12/action-oriented.html">A VC</a>, Dec 2009</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It’s cheating to start a blog post with a quote from Fred Wilson. He is that good. But sometimes you need to cheat and I’m doing it today.</p>

<p>I suggest that you read the <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/12/action-oriented.html">whole article</a>, which exactly captures what startups ought to be doing, and why the cost of not trying is way more than trying and failing.</p>
