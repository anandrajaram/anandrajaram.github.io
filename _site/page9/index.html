As a longtime reader of <a href="http://onstartups.com">onstartups.com</a>, I think it is pretty cool that <a href="http://startable.com">Healy</a> got to blog about our re-branding effort in this popular blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://onstartups.com/ tabid/3339/bid/12156/How-To-Pick-A-Company-Name-Tips-From-The-Trenches.aspx">An interesting and insightful read</a>, I assure.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>I had recently mentioned that <a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2010/03/pixily-is-now-officedrop/">Pixily is now OfficeDrop</a>. There were several valuable lessons that I learnt in how we went about the process. More importantly, not only was the process very successful (Strong positive feedback on the new name, from pretty much everyone that I have spoken with), but also done in a very cost effective way. Maybe a rose by a different name, might not smell as sweet.</p>

<p>We applied the essence of Customer Development to the rebranding effort. After a lot of brainstorming within the company (and how the entire company was involved, <a href="http://bostinnovation.com/2010/03/05/inside-of-a-boston-startup-part-1-why-fresh-ideas-yield-healthy-offices/">as noted by Matt</a>), we actively engaged current customers and potential leads. After further culling of the names based on domain availability, weird meaning in Spanish etc,. we kept revising our shortlist, while engaging customers every step along the way (Think of it as “minimum viable name” ).</p>

<p>For a complete blow-by-blow account on why we felt the need to change the name, how we went about it, and to chime in your thoughts on the new name, check out <a href="http://blog.questionpro.com/2010/03/15/changing-your-company-name-a-real-life-no-cost-process/">Ivana Taylor’s interview</a> today with Healy Jones, our head of Marketing. Plenty of insights, information on what tools we used, tips and tricks await you there.</p>

<p>Have you gone through a similar exercise? What did you learn from it?</p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>I am excited to announce that my company has changed its name to <a href="http://www.officedrop.com">OfficeDrop</a> . There were several key lessons that I learnt during the planning and implementation of the re-branding effort (which is still in progress). We engaged our current and future customers in the name-selection process and thus far the response to the new name has been quite positive.</p>

<p>Our friendly customer service (which I am very proud of), simple user interface and world-class operations are all the same. We will continue to be a very easy to use <a href="http://www.officedrop.com">document management and document scanning service for small businesses</a>. Now our name reflects that better.</p>

<p>I also got to edit the video where Prasad (my partner in crime and CEO of OfficeDrop) talks about the name-change, (inspired by my recent purchase of a brand spanking new Canon camcorder). Here it is, in all its HD glory, to know more about why we changed our name. </p>

<p>Exciting times, and hopefully I will get the time to blog about all those lessons learnt.</p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>I mentioned in <a href="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2009/12/the-cloud-got-a-bit-more-elastic-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/">my earlier post</a> that it would be interesting to compare prices between spot prices and traditional instance prices. The data is already available at http://cloudexchange.org/charts/us-east-1.linux.m1.small.html and it looks like spot prices are waaayy lower than traditional prices.</p>

<p>Stay tuned and it is going to be interesting how this pans out.</p>
