<blockquote>

  <p>the new laziness has nothing to do with physical labor and everything to do with fear. If you’re not going to make those sales calls or invent that innovation or push that insight, you’re not avoiding it because you need physical rest. You’re hiding out because you’re afraid of expending emotional labor.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>Of the different hats I wear at <a href="www.officedrop.com">OfficeDrop</a>, one that I especially relish is in our website design, messaging and poring through funnels (second only to “getting out of the building”). It combines various areas that I am passionate about, including web design, data geeking, copywriting and video editing.</p>

<p>I am thrilled that I am writing a 3-part series on<a href="http://blog.performable.com/optimizing-conversion-rates-with-5-simple-qualitative-quantitative-tests-part-1/"> Optimizing conversion rates using Qualitative and Quantitative Tests</a> at the <a href="http://blog.performable.com">Performable blog</a> . What makes this even awesome-r for me, is that the company was co-founded by <a href="http://davidcancel.com/">David Cancel</a>, one of the rockstars in the Boston Entrepreneurial scene. I have learned a lot of my ghettopreneur habits (such as Fake it before you make it) by attending David’s talks in the area (including my personal favorite on <a href="http://davidcancel.com/data-driven-startups/">Data Driven Startups</a> at a recent <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Lean-Startup-Circle-Boston/">LeanStartups meetup</a>). We learned a lot of valuable lessons in the process of re-designing and re-branding OfficeDrop and I am glad to have the opportunity to share it with the community.</p>

<p>There was a lot of great content, and some posts are pretty detailed and lengthy. Be sure to read them all, I promise it will be worth it. Special Thanks to <a href="http://www.startable.com">Healy Jones</a> for his editorial inputs.</p>

        <p class="post-summary"><p>Here is an awesome presentation on what you ought to know Product Design, by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/putorti">Jason Putorti</a>. My personal favorites are :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Talk <strong>benefits</strong>, not features</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think in <strong>flows</strong>, not screens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dont make the user think</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy! (Hat tip to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/davemcclure">@davemcclure</a> (no pun intended !! )</p>

        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>As a follow-up from themes on books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922">Outliers</a>, Tony Schwartz talk about the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/08/six_keys_to.html">Six keys to be excellent at anything</a>. While there are some more obvious ones, (such as Pursue what you love, Practice Intensely etc,.), there are also some not-so-obvious ones (Take regular renewal breaks, Seek Expert feedback, but only in intermittent doses). As the article notes, it is really empowering to note that the biggest factor in determining how good we become at something is how hard we are willing to work, and not inherited talent.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/linchpin.jpg" alt="linchpin.jpg" /></p>

<p>﻿I happen to agree especially with the 6th tip (Ritualize Practice). The premise is that the best way to insure you’ll take on difficult tasks is to ritualize them. I have found a lot of success with this, be it at a personal level for doing my Weekly GTD Review, or at a professional level for coming up with a consistent dedicated time every week to reach out to users and making a habit out of listening to them.</p>

<p>I also found some interesting nuggets of information, such as :
  * 90 minutes is the maximum amount of time we can bring the highest level of focus to any given activity
  * Great performers practice no more than 4 1/2 hours per day.
  * An interesting quote from Aristotle : <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/aristotle145967.html">We are what we repeatedly do</a>.
Overall, an interesting read.</p>

          <h3 class="h2 post-title">The LeanStartup's guide to scoring a post on TechCrunch</h3>
        
        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>Back in the heydays of blogging, the recipe for getting your startup mentioned in popular blogs like <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a>, went something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start following the blogs of those who care about</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be interesting and start commenting in their blog posts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over time, you will develop a rapport with the author</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your product is beta, invite them to try</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to get a few of them to write on the same day, and start with a splash.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But by now, it is pretty obvious that the top tier bloggers are pretty much as “ivory-towered” as reputed MSM reporters. Whats more, just last week, I read in a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/12/techcrunch-comments/">post in Techcrunch, touting a Chrome plugin that removes TechCrunch comments</a>. All those tips from the self-proclaimed social media experts aren’t worth the keyboard in which they were typed on. Hmm, what is a leanstartup slogging their behind off in a garage to do? Enter me.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I took it upon myself to come up with this flow-chart, that should this whole process as easy as 1-2-3. Here it is</p>

<p>Have you had luck scoring a post with TechCrunch? What has worked for you?</p>
