        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>I went to the MassMobile - Mobile Developers Meetup, organized by Localytics, yesterday. There was a very lively discussion, with participants sharing stories of what worked, what didn’t, and what they are trying now.  Here are my key takeaways / quick summary of the meet up:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/NewImage.png" alt="NewImage" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ice Cream Sandwich is not in anyone’s radar right now. Almost everyone is still thinking about 2.2 and 2.3. (Except maybe Google, which seems to be looking ahead. Looks Like<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/28/forget-about-android-4-0-google-exec-hints-android-5-0-will-launch-in-fall-of-2012/?grcc=33333Z98"> Android 5.0 aka jellybean is coming up soon</a>)</li>
  <li>There were not a lot of real-life pain points around <a href="http://anand.am/ApkpCk">Fragmentation</a> (yet?!). There wasn’t anyone that had to resort to <a href="http://anand.am/wqu8wX">device specific builds</a> or anything funky like that.</li>
  <li>Almost everyone is still developing native apps over HTML5 sites. A couple of folks had gone down the path of HTML5 before deciding to go native largely due to poor user experience on HTML 5.</li>
  <li>There was a lot of interest on the so-called “Hybrid apps”. A few people had prototyped using frameworks such as jQuery Mobile, PhoneGap, but nothing in the market  yet.</li>
  <li>There were not a lot of folks developing for Multiple platforms (such as Android and iOS).</li>
  <li>There was a lot of discussion on how developing for Android would be different than developing for iOS. Three key themes emerged: 
    <ul>
      <li>Actual coding is roughly the same between the two platforms.</li>
      <li>Android has higher demands for testing, due to the varied types of devices and configuration.</li>
      <li>Android has slightly higher UX cost, given the different screen resolutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Windows 7 is still &lt; 5% of the total market share. Apparently, the developer tools are great and development is really easy. Hopefully there will soon be people that actually use it, so we can build some apps for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Raj and the <a href="http://www.localytics.com/">Localytics</a> team for making it useful and informative.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>I guess this one should be filed under “Duh”. The use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(marketing)">personas</a> is pretty common while defining user interfaces and is a valuable tool in defining use cases, usage scenarios.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4093/4852756417_5171fc7b35.jpg" alt="Personas" /></p>

<p>It is a very logical next step as you move from the what to build (through <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html">Customer Development</a>) to the actual building (Product Development). The <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com">KissMetrics blog</a> has a an interesting post today on how you can use Personas to define your SEO Keywords. When figuring out which keywords to optimize for (and bid), it is especially important to speak the “user’s tongue”. Use of the right terminology is not only important within your product, but it is even more important to get it right, to make sure you get your positioning right. Personas help refine the SEO key terms and I think are also a great way to figure out which segment works well and which ones don’t.</p>

<p>While I have used some of the underlying techniques here, I have never actively thought of extending personas in the context of SEO. Overall, a great read.

        <p class="post-summary"><p>This blog post (and graphic) drives home the how manufacturers are not updating Android frequently (<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-i-hate-about-developing-for-android-and-some-workarounds-that-help/2650">my Top 10 peeve with the platform</a>).

  <li>10 of 18 were at least two major versions behind well within their two year contract period.</li>

          <h3 class="h2 post-title">Know Thy Mobile User</h3>
        
        </a>
        <p class="post-summary"><p>Knowing your users and the context in which they are using your app is a key aspect of developing useful and user-engaged mobile apps. This is especially important in a <a href="http://techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-i-hate-about-developing-for-android-and-some-workarounds-that-help/2650">fragmented market</a> (and a recurring theme in the<a href="http://techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-i-hate-about-developing-for-android-and-some-workarounds-that-help/2650"> frustrations of developers</a>). <a href="http://blog.hunch.com/?p=51781">The Hunch Blog</a> has some interesting stats on broad demographics and patterns of iOS and Android users.</p>

<p><a href="http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/blog/droid-vs-ios-inline.png"><img src="http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/android-vs-ios.png" alt="Android vs ios" /></a></p>

<p>Here are a few that I found especially relevant to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stat:</strong> iOS users also travel frequently. (They are 50% more likely to have visited more than five countries and 55% more likely to have used their frequent flyer miles). 
<strong>Takeaway</strong>: Optimize your app for slower data connections and Be sure to test your app in “Airplane mode”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stat:</strong> iOS users are 26% more likely to  prefer spending their money and Android users are 29% more likely to prefer saving their money .
<strong>Takeaway</strong>: Charge for your iOS apps :-) even if it is just 99 cents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**Stat: **iOS Users are early adopters, 50% more likely to first use the Internet before ‘92 and 67% more likely to back up their computer constantly. 
**Takeaway: **This is further confirmation that iCloud is going to have a lot of potential. You start with a user base that backs up constantly and then give them a very easy way for their data to be available everywhere. If you have iOS apps and weren’t already considering iCloud, you should.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other Interesting stats:
  * Android users are 10% more likely to be men and iOS users are 10% more likely to be women.
  * iOS users are 50% more likely to text while driving. (Seriously!)
  * Android users are 50% more likely to use Yahoo! Mail. (Maybe this bodes well for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/18/japan-to-get-android-based-yahoo-phone-next-month/">Yahoo’s upcoming Android phone</a>)</p>

<p>As with any other broad based demographics, analyze it in the context of your users and be sure not to confuse correlation with causation.</p>
