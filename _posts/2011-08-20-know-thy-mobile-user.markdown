Knowing your users and the context in which they are using your app is a key aspect of developing useful and user-engaged mobile apps. This is especially important in a [fragmented market](http://techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-i-hate-about-developing-for-android-and-some-workarounds-that-help/2650) (and a recurring theme in the[ frustrations of developers](http://techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-i-hate-about-developing-for-android-and-some-workarounds-that-help/2650)). [The Hunch Blog](http://blog.hunch.com/?p=51781) has some interesting stats on broad demographics and patterns of iOS and Android users.

[![Android vs ios](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/images/android-vs-ios.png)](http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/blog/droid-vs-ios-inline.png)

Here are a few that I found especially relevant to me:

  * **Stat:** iOS users also travel frequently. (They are 50% more likely to have visited more than five countries and 55% more likely to have used their frequent flyer miles). 
**Takeaway**: Optimize your app for slower data connections and Be sure to test your app in "Airplane mode".

  * **Stat:** iOS users are 26% more likely to  prefer spending their money and Android users are 29% more likely to prefer saving their money .
**Takeaway**: Charge for your iOS apps :-) even if it is just 99 cents

  * **Stat: **iOS Users are early adopters, 50% more likely to first use the Internet before '92 and 67% more likely to back up their computer constantly. 
**Takeaway: **This is further confirmation that iCloud is going to have a lot of potential. You start with a user base that backs up constantly and then give them a very easy way for their data to be available everywhere. If you have iOS apps and weren't already considering iCloud, you should.

Other Interesting stats:
  * Android users are 10% more likely to be men and iOS users are 10% more likely to be women.
  * iOS users are 50% more likely to text while driving. (Seriously!)
  * Android users are 50% more likely to use Yahoo! Mail. (Maybe this bodes well for [Yahoo's upcoming Android phone](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/18/japan-to-get-android-based-yahoo-phone-next-month/))

As with any other broad based demographics, analyze it in the context of your users and be sure not to confuse correlation with causation.
