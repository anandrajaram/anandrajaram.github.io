This "short-form" post from [Gina Tripani](https://twitter.com/ginatrapani) inspired me to get back at it again. Nope, no in-depth medium style pieces, probably a lot of tools/tips style posts and a bunch of link posts (like this one). The last time I wanted to post, I ended up [updating my theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll/), so fingers cross if it'll work out this time.
