Thank you, Steve for inspiring me to create technology that "just works"
Thank you, Steve for proving to me that technology doesn't have to be clunky, messy and awkward
Thank you, Steve for helping me appreciate beautiful design

You sure put a ding in the universe. I promise to Stay Hungry and Stay Foolish.

RIP
