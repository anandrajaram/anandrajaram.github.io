I found this fascinating quote today:

It's cheating to start a blog post with a quote from Fred Wilson. He is that good. But sometimes you need to cheat and I'm doing it today.




I suggest that you read the [whole article](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/12/action-oriented.html), which exactly captures what startups ought to be doing, and why the cost of not trying is way more than trying and failing.
