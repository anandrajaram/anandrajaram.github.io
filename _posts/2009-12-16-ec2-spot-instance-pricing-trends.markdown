I mentioned in [my earlier post](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2009/12/the-cloud-got-a-bit-more-elastic-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/) that it would be interesting to compare prices between spot prices and traditional instance prices. The data is already available at http://cloudexchange.org/charts/us-east-1.linux.m1.small.html and it looks like spot prices are waaayy lower than traditional prices.

Stay tuned and it is going to be interesting how this pans out.
