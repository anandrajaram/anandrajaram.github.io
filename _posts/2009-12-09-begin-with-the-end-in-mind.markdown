I am a long time follower of the now-popular GTD methodology, and the recent blog post about [Infusing GTD into Marketing](http://www.gtdtimes.com/2009/12/07/infusing-gtd-into-your-marketing/) makes perfect sense. With Marketing, as with defining features and developing them, it is important to define goals and know when something is "Done". This, in a way, is a great corollary to "If you are not measuring, you are not marketing". What better way to know if you are done, than when you measure. Here are a few examples of concrete goals that I can think of:



	
  * We will stop the A/B test when we B outperforms A in conversion by half percentage point for atleast one week.

	
  * The newsletter to convert free users to paid users will be tweaked until we see a X % improvement in conversion rate, Y% improvement in click through and Z% improvement in open rates.


This is especially difficult for startups, where resources are even more constrained than other companies. Asking what “done” and “success” look like are two quick and easy ways to infuse GTD into your marketing processes and realize some immediate benefits.

So, begin with the end in mind.
