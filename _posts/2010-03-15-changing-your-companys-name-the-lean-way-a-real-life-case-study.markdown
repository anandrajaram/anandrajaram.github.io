I had recently mentioned that [Pixily is now OfficeDrop](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2010/03/pixily-is-now-officedrop/). There were several valuable lessons that I learnt in how we went about the process. More importantly, not only was the process very successful (Strong positive feedback on the new name, from pretty much everyone that I have spoken with), but also done in a very cost effective way. Maybe a rose by a different name, might not smell as sweet.

We applied the essence of Customer Development to the rebranding effort.Â After a lot of brainstorming within the company (and how the entire company was involved, [as noted by Matt](http://bostinnovation.com/2010/03/05/inside-of-a-boston-startup-part-1-why-fresh-ideas-yield-healthy-offices/)), we actively engaged current customers and potential leads. After further culling of the names based on domain availability, weird meaning in Spanish etc,. we kept revising our shortlist, while engaging customers every step along the way (Think of it as "minimum viable name" ).

For a complete blow-by-blow account on why we felt the need to change the name, how we went about it, and to chime in your thoughts on the new name, check out [Ivana Taylor's interview](http://blog.questionpro.com/2010/03/15/changing-your-company-name-a-real-life-no-cost-process/) today with Healy Jones, our head of Marketing. Plenty of insights, information on what tools we used, tips and tricks await you there.

Have you gone through a similar exercise? What did you learn from it?
