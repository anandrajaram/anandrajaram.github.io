Reading the 37Signals blog post about [picking a theme](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3818-a-new-years-theme-more-questions-less-me-talk) for the new year rather than a resolution really resonated with me too. 

__My theme for 2015 is going to be : Creation__

If you think about "Stuff" (content / knowledge work / whatever), there is a hierachy of Creation, Curation and Consumption. I'd give myself a 9/10 in Consumption, probably a 6/10 in curation and a measly 3 out of 10 in Creation.

This year, I want to change that. I want to get more deliberate about curating and do more creating.
