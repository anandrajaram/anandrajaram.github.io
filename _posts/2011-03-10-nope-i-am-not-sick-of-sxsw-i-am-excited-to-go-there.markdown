This is my first [SXSW](http://sxsw.com) and I am excited. I dont care [what the naysayers say](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/07/sxsgah/), I am determined to have a fun time, especially while meeting our customers as part of [the Small business web](http://thesmallbusinessweb.com) Party! (and [Healy Jones](http://startable.com) will be joining me too!)

In addition to the Lean Startup tracks, I am also looking forward to the tracks on User Interface Design (iPad Design, Metrics Driven Design to name a few). It should be fun to bump into some familiar [Boston area peeps](http://bostinnovation.com/2011/03/07/boston-all-up-in-sxswi-preview-sxswbos/?ref=act&buid=0) in [Boston In Austin happy hour](http://bostoninaustinsxsw.eventbrite.com/#m_1_200). I booked an apartment through [AirBnB](http://airbnb.com) (my first time, so lets hope this works out!) and I have also armed myself with the latest versions of Foursquare, Groupme, Beluga and Plancast. Austin, here I come!!!




Are you going to South-by? Here is a quick embed from my Plancast feed.





And, here are some tips on how to be South by South Best!
