Of the different hats I wear at [OfficeDrop](www.officedrop.com), one that I especially relish is in our website design, messaging and poring through funnels (second only to "getting out of the building"). It combines various areas that I am passionate about, including web design, data geeking, copywriting and video editing.

I am thrilled that I am writing a 3-part series on[ Optimizing conversion rates using Qualitative and Quantitative Tests](http://blog.performable.com/optimizing-conversion-rates-with-5-simple-qualitative-quantitative-tests-part-1/) at the [Performable blog](http://blog.performable.com) . What makes this even awesome-r for me, is that the company was co-founded by [David Cancel](http://davidcancel.com/), one of the rockstars in the Boston Entrepreneurial scene. I have learned a lot of my ghettopreneur habits (such as Fake it before you make it) by attending David's talks in the area (including my personal favorite on [Data Driven Startups](http://davidcancel.com/data-driven-startups/) at a recent [LeanStartups meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Lean-Startup-Circle-Boston/)). We learned a lot of valuable lessons in the process of re-designing and re-branding OfficeDrop and I am glad to have the opportunity to share it with the community.

There was a lot of great content, and some posts are pretty detailed and lengthy. Be sure to read them all, I promise it will be worth it. Special Thanks to [Healy Jones](http://www.startable.com) for his editorial inputs.
