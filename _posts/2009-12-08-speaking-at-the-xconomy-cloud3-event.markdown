I am very excited to be a part of the [Xconomy Cloud 3 Forum](http://xconomyforum16.eventbrite.com/) this Thursday (Dec 10). I will be speaking about our experiences with the Cloud and subsequently be a part of the Unpanel. I am especially excited about the “Un”panel, inspired by un-conferences.  The unpanel will start with a general theme: the practical realities of cloud computing, with an emphasis on the various types of cloud services available today, who’s offering them, how to use them in your business, and maybe how to grow your own cloud services company. But the specific questions will be up to the audience.




I have just put the finishing touches to my talk. I will be sharing our experiences with the Cloud, and specifically the Amazon Web Services, and provide details on how the cloud helps us keep our fixed costs low, scale easily and most importantly, pass on those cost savings to our customers. I have also taken out the crystal ball and ventured into some predictions for the future and identified a few key learnings that anyone new to cloud computing can take advantage of.




Are there any specific topics you would like to be discussed?





There are only a few seats remaining, so [Register now](http://xconomyforum16.eventbrite.com/) to attend what promises to be a great day of learning, sharing and networking. See you there.I am very excited to be a part of the Xconomy Cloud 3 Forum this Thursday (Dec 10). I will be speaking about our experiences with the Cloud and subsequently be a part of the Unpanel.
