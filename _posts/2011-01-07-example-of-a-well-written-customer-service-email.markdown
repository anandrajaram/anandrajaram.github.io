In my [observations on the Mac App Store](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2011/01/observations-on-the-mac-app-store/) yesterday, I had mentioned that I had accidentally purchased an App and noted that the support URL from the FAQ didnt work (it was subsequently fixed).




Meanwhile, I had opened a support request with the iTunes App Store (which is different than the Mac App Store). I wasn't really hoping on anything concrete, and likely a "We are iTunes App Store, we can't help with Mac App STore" style email, so I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email from Apple Customer Service today.

Â 




This email has all the ingredients of a well-written customer service email :






  * It has a conversational tone by using my first name at the end of sentences. 


  * It communicates empathy ("I can appreciate how eager you must be to get your money back"). 


  * It tells me what action has been taken now (The transaction is flagged) 


  * It tells me when I can expect something to change (5 business days).
