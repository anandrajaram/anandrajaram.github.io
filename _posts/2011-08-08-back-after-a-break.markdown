It has been a hectic past few months. We launched our mobile apps for the [iPhone](http://www.officedrop.com/iphone-pdf) and the [Android](http://www.officedrop.com/android-paper-to-go), and also launched our partnership with Nuance Communications to launch [PaperPort Anywhere](http://paperport.com), the cloud-powered version of PaperPort software.

Rolling out the two mobile apps, a tablet app was exciting, to say the least. You can expect a lot more of my thoughts on those in the coming days (and fanboys always have an opinion, don't they?!). Meanwhile, you are welcome to catch up on my guest blog posts :

  * AtÂ [KissMetrics blog](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/1-2-punch-for-increasing-conversion/), I write about how we increased conversion in OfficeDrop by listening to our customers, leads and effectively using those tools.


  * My chat with Morgan Friberg of Atlassian about [how we do Product Development at OfficeDrop](http://blogs.atlassian.com/news/2011/04/case_study_issue_tracking_and_agile_development_at_officedro.html) and how Jira helps us develop markets that people love and use!

Stay tuned, and happy to be writing again!
