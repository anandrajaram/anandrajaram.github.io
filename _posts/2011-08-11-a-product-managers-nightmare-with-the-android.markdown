My observations on the pain points of developing for the Android platform, and suggested workarounds for those pain points are published today in [TechRepublic](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-things-i-hate-about-developing-for-android-and-some-workarounds-that-help/2650). To summarize a few key points :






  * Fragmentation is a nightmare and makes Android development a lot more complicated than it should be. 


  * There should be broad based agreements on what manufacturers and carriers can and cannot do to the platform, and the ecosystem should work together to provide a good, solid baseline that all developers can take or granted. It is in the best interest of the platform


  * Google should act as a "good cop" in helping the platform as it matures. 


  * Patent related issues (aka "The Pink Elephant in the room") need to be addressed sooner than later.

And finally, I'd like to leave you with an image (From Engadget) that I think captures the gist of all things wrong about the platform. Think about it!
