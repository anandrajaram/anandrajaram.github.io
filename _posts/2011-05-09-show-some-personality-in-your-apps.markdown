A great way to be friendly to your customers is to project some personality in your apps (and hopefully it reflects your company's true personality). 
[Google Doodles](http://www.google.com/logos/) are pretty popular and it is a pretty good proof that you can show off stuff, even though there isn't much in your "home page".


I found a couple of nice examples this week that I thought I would share.


The first is from [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com). On May 4th, their login page had been updated to reflect "Star wars day", aka, May the 4th be with you.

The other example I found was for the release notes for the Yelp iPhone App (And yes, you can judge me by the fact that I read release notes of the apps I use)

Both are nice examples that bring a smile to your customer's face when they come across them. Well done. How do you make your apps have a personality?
