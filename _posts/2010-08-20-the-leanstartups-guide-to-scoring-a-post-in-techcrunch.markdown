Back in the heydays of blogging, the recipe for getting your startup mentioned in popular blogs like [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com), went something like this:

  * Be interesting and start commenting in their blog posts


  * Over time, you will develop a rapport with the author


  * When your product is beta, invite them to try


  * Try to get a few of them to write on the same day, and start with a splash.




But by now, it is pretty obvious that the top tier bloggers are pretty much as "ivory-towered" as reputed MSM reporters. Whats more, just last week, I read in a [post in Techcrunch, touting a Chrome plugin that removes TechCrunch comments](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/12/techcrunch-comments/).
