I am excited to announce that my company has changed its name to [OfficeDrop](http://www.officedrop.com) . There were several key lessons that I learnt during the planning and implementation of the re-branding effort (which is still in progress). We engaged our current and future customers in the name-selection process and thus far the response to the new name has been quite positive.

Our friendly customer service (which I am very proud of), simple user interface and world-class operations are all the same. We will continue to be a very easy to use [document management and document scanning service for small businesses](http://www.officedrop.com). Now our name reflects that better.

I also got to edit the video where Prasad (my partner in crime and CEO of OfficeDrop) talks about the name-change, (inspired by my recent purchase of a brand spanking new Canon camcorder). Here it is, in all its HD glory, to know more about why we changed our name. 



Exciting times, and hopefully I will get the time to blog about all those lessons learnt.
