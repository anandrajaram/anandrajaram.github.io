Last week, I had posted an analysis of a [customer service email I received from Apple](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2011/01/example-of-a-well-written-customer-service-email/). It had all the elements of a well-written email (and there is a happy ending to that story, Apple refunded me the money!). Flowtown, (which I knew first as a [case study for a Lean Startup](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2010/04/drinking-from-the-fire-hose-lessons-i-learned-from-the-startup-lessons-learned-conference-part-1/) ) has dissected the anatomy of Apple's promotional email.




Clear layout, Well designed call to actions, and useful tips (such as Did you know?) are the hallmarks of a good converting email. Here is the complete anatomy . Thanks, Flowtown.
