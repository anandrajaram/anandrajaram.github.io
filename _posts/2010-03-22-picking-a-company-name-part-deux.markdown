As a follow-up to [Ivana Taylor's interview with Healy Jones](http://www.startupproductmanager.com/2010/03/changing-your-companys-name-the-lean-way-a-real-life-case-study/), here is another in-depth lookÂ at our re-branding effort and how we went about the process of "Pixily is now OfficeDrop". As a longtime reader of [onstartups.com](http://onstartups.com), I think it is pretty cool that [Healy](http://startable.com) got to blog about our re-branding effort in this popular blog.

[An interesting and insightful read](http://onstartups.com/ tabid/3339/bid/12156/How-To-Pick-A-Company-Name-Tips-From-The-Trenches.aspx), I assure.
