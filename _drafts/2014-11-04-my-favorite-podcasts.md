Podcasting is back! 

new yorker attributes it to the connected car. My own use of podcasts has coincided with parts of my career when I have had long commutes. I re-discovered podcasts a few years ago, and accidentally bumped into Dan Benjamin's 5by5 network. I think of them as the NPR of podcasts. (Actually NPR is also the NPR Of podcasts). 

I have a whole lot of podcasts in my podcast app, and am not organized enough to set up playlists. I usually choose one based on what I am in the mood for / something topical. I used to use [Downcast](), but have switched to [Overcast]() since it launched. I was pretty happy with Downcast, but being a fan of Marco's work, I switched to Overcast. The Smart Speed feature is great! 

If you are looking to get started, here are some of my recommendations, grouped by Topic, and roughly arranged from "I listen to every single episode" to 

## Mac Geekery / Tools
* ATP
* The Talk Show
* Debug

## Startups / Business
* Exponent / Stratechery 
* a16z podcast
* 500 startups

## Product 
* ProductHunt Radio
* Product People
* Jobs to be Done Radio


## 5by5
* Back to Work
* Mac Power Users
* Systematic

## General Interest

* Freakonomics
* Good Job Brain
* Pragmatic

## NPR

* TED Radio 

* Inquiring Minds 
This podcast really gets me thinking hard about a topic and challenges my assumptions. I have arguably changed my worldview of GMO foods based on this podcast. 

* Wait Wait Dont tell me

* This American Life 
* Radiolab

There are two recent suggestions that I am excited to check out, These would be new formats for me in podcasts. 

TODO: Is there a way to provide OPML files here so people can bulk import a category? 

Podcasting as a Marketing channel

I used to skip ads maniacally in my early days of podcasting. I skip ads even now, especially if they are read off a script. I love it when the podcast host/guest talk about their experience with the sponsor's product/service or that problem space. It is native advertising at its best. As I think back for this post, a lot of services that I use today are ones that I have discovered through a podcast. Here are a few: 

* Hover - Domain Names, done well. Nearly all my domains are transferred over to hover. 
* Fracture - Amazing way to show off your pictures and app-icons. 
* Gloves. 
* Backblaze for backup.
* Automatic
