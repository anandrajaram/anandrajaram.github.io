Yes, there is the not so subtle "Surprise me" option in preferences. 

*  able to quote people. 
*  Previewing links, tweets, images
*  Spotify live
*  Disabled message field when there is no connection. 
*  If I miss up (post a giphy link to something that doesnt exist etc, it notifies only me and doesnt make me look stupid or waster everyone's time) 
*  Onboarding via slackbot (http://www.useronboard.com/how-slack-onboards-new-users/)
* Sensible defaults that change as usage changes : [Defaults](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAJ18CAPF_JFEoS24bhDSPUd66KBt_PgJoI )

The ability to express in better ways and contextualiziing the tools is going to be an important aspect of remote working and Slack gets it. 

Something about the consumerization of enterprise.
