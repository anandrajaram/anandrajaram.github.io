A few days back, I re-discovered this gem of a post on [Pixar’s 22 rules of story telling](http://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/07/pixars-22-rules-of-storytelling/)

Nearly every one of these rules is applicable for product managers too, but wanted to highlight the four that I thought were especially useful.

| The storyteller version     | The Product Manager Version     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
|You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be very different.| Change Audience to user and writer to "hacker" |
| Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it. | Why must you build THIS feature (or product)? Of all the zillion things that your awesome team can be building why this ? How does this connect back to your product and your company’s goals?|
| Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone. | Ship your MVP. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.|
|What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.| What is the elevator pitch for your product? The simplest way of communicating its value and the reason it should exist. If you know that, you can build out from there.

Ok, so the two columns weren't all that different. But that IS my point. And here is a bonus analogy from Brian McDonald, who is credited with Rule 4 of the 22 rules :

Legendary director Sydney Pollack once said that if you ask a writer what their script is about and they start giving you plot, then you’re in trouble.

If you ask a PM what their product is about and they start listing features, then you are in trouble. Start with the WHY, stick to the benefits, not the features.

P.S : Brian also busts one of the recent memes myths about [my most favorite superhero](http://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/22/the-story-spine-pixars-4th-rule-of-storytelling/).
